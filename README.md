# CPU.RISC-V
This is a custom implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V CPU supporting the **RV32I** base integer instruction set. The processor is fully modular, with a 3-stage pipeline (IF–ID–EX/WB), and is designed to demonstrate understanding of digital design principles, RTL coding, and pipelined processor architecture.
